# Canvas HW Reminder
An App that Reminds You When Your Homework is Due!

## How it Works?
Every hour, Canvas HW Reminder checks for any updates to your Canvas Page such as new assignments.

If new assignments are posted, Canvas HW Reminder will quickly check for the assignment that has the closest due date. Then it will simply wait until it is time to remind you about the assignment.

**All Information is Always Locally Saved and Never Sent to Any Server!**

## What Powers It?
ElectronJS is used to handle the rendering and app functionality.

The Public Canvas LMS Instructure API is used for to know what courses are enrolled and what assignments are due next.
